# A Novel Method for Flexible Capacity Multi-Image Hiding

This repository contains the official implementation of my Master's Thesis:
**"A Novel Method for Flexible Capacity Multi-Image Hiding"**, which proposes a
deep learning framework for secure and high-capacity image steganography.

## 🔍 Overview
The project introduces an **Invertible Hiding Neural Network (IHNN)** combined
with a **Super-Resolution (SR) module** to embed and recover multiple secret
images within a single cover image. The system achieves a balance between
imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness.

## 📊 Key Contributions
- Developed a **multi-image steganography system** using deep learning.
- Designed a **forward concealing** and **backward revealing** architecture.
- Conducted an **ablation study** (computational cost, DWT, bicubic interpolation).
- Evaluated performance on benchmark datasets (DIV2K, COCO, ImageNet).

## 📂 Repository Structure
# Implementation of IHNN
# Implementation of SR modules

## 📚 Datasets
Experiments were conducted using:
- DIV2K (800 high-resolution images)
- COCO (120K diverse images)
- ImageNet (1.2M+ large-scale dataset)

## 📐 Evaluation Metrics
- **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 🚀 Future Work
- Extending to **different data modalities** (e.g., 3D medical images).
- Improving **trade-off optimization** between imperceptibility and payload.
